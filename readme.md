Library Management System  
Setup Instructions

This is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for managing library operations.  
Users can browse, like, borrow, and return books, while admins can manage the inventory.  
The app includes user authentication, real-time book availability updates, and borrow history tracking.
